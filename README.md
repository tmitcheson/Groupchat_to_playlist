# Groupchat to Playlist

Script identifies Spotify shares in a Messenger chat JSON and uploads them to a public playlist.

On subsequent downloads of the same chat history, script will identify 'new' tracks and only upload them thus avoiding duplicates in playlist

Requires user to set up a .env file with their own Spotify clientID and client secret and to change the variables to their own playlist.
